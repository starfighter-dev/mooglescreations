            <h1>Shipping Policy</h1>
            <p>Last updated: 1st July 2023</p>
            <p>Thank you for choosing Moogle's Creations! We are dedicated to providing you with the best possible shopping experience. This Shipping Policy outlines the terms and conditions regarding the shipping of your orders.</p>
            <h2>Processing Time:</h2>
            <p>All orders are processed within 10 business days (excluding weekends and bank holidays) after receiving full payment. Please allow additional time during peak seasons or promotional periods.</p>
            <h2>Shipping Methods and Delivery:</h2>
            <p>We offer various shipping methods to cater to your needs. The available shipping options will be displayed during the checkout process.</p>
            <p>Moogle's Creations partners with reputable carriers to ensure timely and secure delivery. The carrier for each order will be selected based on factors such as destination, package size, and shipping method.</p>
            <p>Delivery times are approximate and may vary depending on the destination and shipping carrier's efficiency. Please note that unforeseen circumstances such as weather conditions or customs delays may impact delivery times.</p>
            <h2>Shipping Rates:</h2>
            <p>Shipping rates are calculated based on the weight, dimensions, and destination of the package. The shipping cost will be displayed at checkout before you finalise your purchase.</p>
            <p>We may offer free shipping promotions from time to time. These promotions will be clearly indicated on our website.</p>
            <h2>Order Tracking:</h2>
            <p>If you have paid for Expedited Shipping, once your order has been shipped, you will receive a shipping confirmation email containing a tracking number. You can use this tracking number to track the progress of your shipment on our website or through the carrier's website.</p>
            <h2>International Shipping:</h2>
            <p>We currently offer international shipping to select countries. Please note that international orders may be subject to customs duties, taxes, and fees imposed by the destination country. These charges are the responsibility of the recipient and are not included in the purchase price or shipping cost.</p>
            <p>We recommend checking with your local customs office for information on potential charges before placing an international order.</p>
            <p>Some items may be restricted for international shipping due to local laws or regulations. Please check the product page for any shipping restrictions.</p>
            <h2>Address Accuracy:</h2>
            <p>Please ensure that the shipping address provided during checkout is accurate and complete. We are not responsible for packages that are lost or delayed due to incorrect or incomplete addresses. Any additional shipping costs incurred due to address errors will be the responsibility of the customer.</p>
            <h2>Lost or Damaged Packages:</h2>
            <p>In the rare event that your package is lost or damaged during transit, please contact our customer support team.</p>
            <p>Orders that are lost in the post will be resent by us once we have verified the correct delivery details. UK orders are classed as lost 10 working days after dispatch. International orders are classed as lost 32 working days after dispatch. If a parcel is returned to us because you supplied us with an incorrect address, we will request that you pay an additional shipping payment so we can resend the order to you.</p>
            <p>If a parcel is delayed or lost because you supplied us with an incorrect address, this is not covered under our replacement guarantee and we cannot resend your order free of charge. You will be required to place a new order or wait for the parcel to hopefully be returned to us which can take a few months.</p>

            <p>Non-Returnable Items: The following items are non-returnable unless they are received in a damaged or defective condition:</p>
